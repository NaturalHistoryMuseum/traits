The leaves are lance-shaped to oblong. The inflorescence takes the form of a spike, a panicle, or a raceme. It may be hooded in bracts and bracteoles. The flower has a shallowly toothed calyx which is sometimes split on one side. The flower corolla is a cylindrical tube with three lobes at the mouth, the middle lobe larger and hoodlike in some taxa. There is one fertile stamen and two staminodes, which are often joined into a petal-like labellum, a structure that is inconspicuous in some species and quite showy in others. The fruit is a rounded, dry or fleshy capsule.[2][3] The plants are generally aromatic due to their essential oils.[6]

They have ""pseudostems"" formed by the tightly wrapped basal sheaths of their leaves. Depending on the species, the pseudostems may be 25–80 cm (10–31 in) high. Individual leaves consist of a sheath and a blade. At the junction of the sheath and blade, there is a stalk (petiole), which may be very short or absent.[3] The plants die back in the winter with shoots appearing again in spring.[4]

The yellow or orange flowers appear in the summer and are grouped into a spike (inflorescence). Each flower is surrounded by a persistent coloured bract. The sepals are joined to form a tubular calyx, divided on one side. The bases of the petals are fused to form a tube as long as or longer than the calyx. At the end of this tube the three petals form separate lobes: the central lobe is upright and narrower than the two side lobes. Inside the petal tube there are three petal-like structures (formed from staminodes). The side staminodes are upright. The broad central lip or labellum is bent downwards. It has a narrowed section (claw) at its base which is joined to the side lobes of the petal tube.[3]

There is a single stamen with a short upright filament. Connective tissue at the base of the anther forms a fork-like appendage. After fertilization, the seed capsule splits to the base showing a mass of red, grey or black seeds.[3]

 Hornstedtia arunachalensis S. Tripathi & V. Prakash (Nordic J. Bot. 19: 329. 1999) was recently described from extreme SE Xizang. It was compared with the Malesian species,  H. scyphifera (J. König) Steudel, from which it differs in having fusiform, closed-mouthed inflorescences, white corolla lobes, and a whitish labellum without lateral auricles. No specimens have been seen by the present authors. From the description and illustration,  H. arunachalensis seems similar to  H. tibetica, and the two may perhaps be conspecific.",,,,

There are up to 22 recognized species, of which 8 are endemic to China.[1][2] Typically they grow in grassland, in screes or on the edges of deciduous woodland at heights of 1,200–5,000 metres (3,900–16,400 ft), coming into growth at the start of the monsoon season.[3]

Species of Roscoea are small perennial herbaceous plants. They die back each year to a short vertical rhizome, to which the tuberous roots are attached. Like many members of the Zingiberales (the order to which the gingers belong), Roscoea has ""pseudostems"": structures which resemble stems but are actually formed from the tightly wrapped bases of its leaves (""sheaths""). The leaves are without a stalk (petiole). Lower leaves may consist solely of a sheath; upper leaves have a blade which is free from the pseudostem, and is oblong or lanceolate (i.e. considerably longer than it is wide).[2] The relative number of bladeless versus complete leaves is one distinguishing feature of the two clades into which the genus is divided.[4]

The flowers are borne in a spike at the end of the pseudostems. The stalk (peduncle) bearing the flowers may be long, so that the flowers appear well above the leaves, or short, so that they appear between the upper leaf sheaths.[5] Like other members of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), Roscoea flowers have a complex structure (superficially resembling that of an orchid,[6] although they are not related). Each flower has a tube-shaped outer calyx, which is split on one side and ends in two or three teeth. The petals are joined together at the base, and then divide into three lobes. The central lobe is upright and usually forms a hood; the two side lobes are narrower than the central one. The flower then has what appear to be three inner petals, which are actually formed from four sterile stamens (staminodes). Two lateral staminodes form what look like upright petals, often also hooded in shape; two other staminodes are fused together to form a prominent central ""lip"" or labellum.[2][Note 1]

The single fertile stamen has a short filament bearing a cylindrical anther. The connective tissue between the anther's two pollen sacs extends outwards at its base to form spurs. The ovary has three ""cells"" or locules, eventually producing many small arillate seeds. The single functional style extends upwards through a grove in the stamen to appear above its top.[2][7]
