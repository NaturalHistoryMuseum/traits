Scales grey brown, often tinged wine red, soon becoming fibrous.           Stems trigonous, smooth below, rough above, ± decumbent at base. Lvs 12-40 x 2-4 mm, concave, often curved, thick, bluntly keeled or channelled, gradually tapering to a trigonous point up to 5 cm long, mid green, ± shiny. Ligule 1-4 mm, broadly ovate or almost truncate. Lower sheaths lfless, persistent, thick, white, tinged with red. Infl 1/5-1/4 lngth of stem. Lower bract lf-like, about as long as infl, not sheathing, upper glumaceous.  Male spike 1(-2), 10-15 x 3 mm, fusiform. Male glumes 3-4 mm, ovate, acute or obtuse, dark purple-black with hyaline margin. Female spikes 1-2(-3), ± contiguous, (5-)10-15(-20) x 4-5 mm, ovoid or subglobose, erect, lower peduncled, upper ±  sessile. Female glumes 2-3 mm, ovate, acute, dark purplish-brown with pale midrib and hyaline margin, shorter than fr.  Utricle 3-3.5 mm, smooth, ±          inflated, dark purple green in upper half, shiny. Beak 0.5 mm, ±          notched. Stigmas 2, rarely 3. Nut 2 mm, subglobose.' 
    text = "Perennials, 40-100 cm tall 1 x 2 cm (usually rhizomatous, sometimes stoloniferous). Stems 1(-4), erect, simple or branched, densely lanate-tomentose to glabrate. Leaves petiolate (proximally) or sessile (distally, weakly clasping and gradually reduced); blades oblong or lanceolate, 3.5-35+ cm x 5-35 mm, 1-2-pinnately lobed (ultimate lobes +- lanceolate, often arrayed in multiple planes), faces glabrate to sparsely tomentose or densely lanate. Heads 10-100+, in simple or compound, corymbiform arrays. Phyllaries 20-30 in +- 3 series, (light green, midribs dark green to yellowish, margins green to light or dark brown) ovate to lanceolate, abaxial faces tomentose. Receptacles convex; paleae lanceolate, 1.5-4 mm. Ray florets (3-)5-8, pistillate, fertile; corollas white or light pink to deep purple, laminae 1.5-3 x 1.5-3 mm. Disc florets 10-20; corollas white to grayish white, 2-4.5 mm. Cypselae 1-2 mm (margins broadly winged). 2n = 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72 (including counts from Europe). Morphologic characters that have been used to segregate these populations into species and/or varieties include: (1) degree and persistence of tomentum; (2) phyllaries with greenish, light brown, or dark brown margins; (3) shapes of capitulescences (rounded or flat-topped); and (4) degrees of leaf dissection and shapes of lobes."
